# SARS-CoV-2-genome-data
In this repository, the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the GenBank and GISAID databases are housed with their corresponding alignments in the GUANE-1 supercomputer of the Industrial University of Santnader for 2020. These results are the product of the technological developments generated in the project entitled: "Contribution to the diagnostic protocol of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the Influenza A H1N1 Virus by real-time RT-PCR in one step authorized by the World Health Organization with the inclusion of marker genes required for viral infection and their validation by next-generation genomic sequencing with nucleotide concentration technology" financed by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MinCiencias) of Colombia with call No. 1015-2020 - Mincinciaton.
